As a river meanders between various lands and creates a course, learning many a things; this 
blog is a reflection of my musings during my ride in the roller-coaster called <b>code</b>.
<b>Keep Walking</b> is a collection of all my learnings I have gained as a software developer

have created over time.

language. What could be a better way than discovering the music inside yourself than Poetry? 
Words are the soul of any rythm, any sort of music.
