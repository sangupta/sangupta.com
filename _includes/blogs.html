I maintain the following two blogs as this is where my heart lies:

<h3>
	<a href="/tech/index.html">Keep Walking!</a>

As a river meanders between various lands and creates a course, learning many a things; this 
blog is a reflection of my musings during my ride in the roller-coaster called <b>code</b>.

	<a href="/poetry/index.html">Poet Inside</a>
</h3>

The music of language, intricate rhyme schemes, elegant phrases, vivid images - the art of

language. What could be a better way than discovering the music inside yourself than Poetry? 
Words are the soul of any rythm, any sort of music.
