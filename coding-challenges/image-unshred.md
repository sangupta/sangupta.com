Instagram posted a [challenge on image unshredding](http://instagram-engineering.tumblr.com/post/12651721845/instagram-engineering-challenge-the-unshredder) in 
2011 around stiching back pieces of an image that has been shredded. My solution 
for the same can be found in my GitHub repository 
at [Image Unshred](https://github.com/sangupta/image-unshred).
