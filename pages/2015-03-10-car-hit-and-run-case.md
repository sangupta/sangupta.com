## FRAUD People: Jaideep Shingari and Reena Rawat

Last week on the day of Holi - I became a victim to a car hit and run case. The story being a little
different that the run was an intentional deferred one - of absconding.

On 6th March 2015, at around 10:40pm, I reached my society back in my car after having dinner. As being
late in the night, the society gate was locked and closed. I honked gently to let the guards know that I
wanted to get in the society. I was waiting for the guard to unlock the society gate and open it, with my
car in the front of the gate and being **completely stationary**.

At this point, a car just backed up and hit my rear door (the driver side) at speed. Looked like the driver
pressed the accelarator to back off in style and speed. Their car rammed in my stationary car. I came out
of the car and saw that the entire rear door was damaged. I was about to start clicking photos of the people
inside the car, when a friend of mine from the same society came rushing. This guy (let's call him `Mr. X`) 
immediately asked me to stop, and said:

> I am giving you my word, that these folks will pay all the damages. They are my friends - they will
> pay up all the damages.

By this time, the driver of the car came out of the car. The driver was a lady called `Mrs. Reena Rawat`. To
me she looked a bit **drunk**, but I can't be sure. She said:

> I am sorry - I just did not see your car. I actually was not looking into the rear view mirrors as it is late
> in the night, nor did I hear the honks. I was lost in my own thoughts - I was thinking of something.

`Mr. X` again reiterated that the damages will be paid. To this, `Reena` also confirmed that she will be paying
all the damages.

The other person in the car, was Reena's husband, `Mr. Jaideep Shingari`. His mobile number being `9871-233-620`.
`Jaideep` did not even had the courtesy to come forward and say that I will be paying the damages. He hid besides
the car. It was `Mr. X` and `Reena` who kept on reiterating that they will pay up the damages. Being a good citizen,
I trusted `Mr. X` (him being from Adobe) and `Reena` (being an literate lady - can't call them educated, as
they have now run away) and did not call the PCR van. This was my **big mistake**.

These guys took leave. For the next two days, I kept on contacting `Mr. Jaideep` to come over and pay for the
damages at a Maruti Showroom. But this fellow kept on making excuses and did not budge, nor did he come to
any of the showrooms to pay for damages.

Now for the last 2 days, this guy, `Mr. Jaideep` is absconding, not picking up my calls, not replying to my texts. 
The mediator `Mr. X` has also cut corners, and is avoiding pretending that he is helpless. Note that `Mr. X` is not
ready to reveal me the address or the company at which `Mr. Jaideep` works.

I fail to understand what sort of people these three are: `Mr. X`, `Mr. Jaideep Shingari` and `Mrs. Reena Rawat`. What
kind of culture, values and upbringing their families have provided them. `Jaideep` and `Reena` are a total **fraud**
who don't even have the guts to accept what they did, or to pay for the loss I incurred due to them.

Such people are **literate** but not **educated**.

I despise these people. Sick!

**Being a good Indian, I am not posting the pic of `Reena` or disclosing her profile link. This is my upbringing!**
