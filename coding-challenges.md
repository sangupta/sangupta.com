### Project Euler

<a href="https://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a> is a series of challenging mathematical/computer 
programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics 
will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills 
will be required to solve most problems.
