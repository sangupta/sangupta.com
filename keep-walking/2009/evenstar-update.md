`evenstar` is a dream, a dream that lets my imagination fly on wings of hope, 
hope that my prayers would be answered, answered with a gift, a gift that is 
worth everything I may ever be.

<!-- break here -->

They say necessity is the mother of all invention. For me, it has been the 
sucker of many odd hours at night leading to the development of a blogging engine. 
Yes, `evenstar` is a blogging engine! For the geeks and interested here are 
the technical specifications:

* Open-source Java-based blogging engine running on Google App Engine - so anyone with a Google Account can run it for free, yeah!
* Support for multiple blogs via a single instance
* Blog layout templates based on the powerful <a href="http://velocity.apache.org/">Velocity</a> templating engine
* A post system featuring author-defined permission on who can view, what can be viewed
* A commenting system featuring various protection modes, on who can view the comments
* An author controlled post URLs - with default automatic mode aka Blogger style<br>
* Integration with popular tools<br>
* Wired with Google Authentication
* Integrated email notifications, RSS/Atom feeds
* Powerful user management - both for authors and viewers
* REST based open architecture - go build your own UI
* Ability to <i>prettify</i> code snippets - for the developer community
* Import previous blogs from popular systems
* Sanitization of incoming/outgoing HTML
* Powerful system to manage which posts are allowed to be crawled and indexed
* Integrated post-search honoring author-defined permissions

This is just a broad level of features planned/in-development. Drop your comments for,

* on thoughts over building this new system up
* for lending a helping hand in this intiative
* for catching an early-preview (sometime late Dec 09)

This is just a small peek into the dream of mine, 
<i>and I leave it to you to find about the gift I seek.</i>
