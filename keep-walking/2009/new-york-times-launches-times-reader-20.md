New York Times released a Times Reader which makes reading online newspaper fun 
and exciting. Times Reader enables a user to read New York Times without a web 
browser. This might not look like a big change considering the fact that NYT is 
already available on web via a browser, but, the sparkling difference is the compelling 
and commanding interface. And yes, for those who might not have picked it up, Times Reader 
is a desktop application. Yes, it is !!!

<!-- break here -->

Times Reader makes reading news worthy as the interface is built specifically for the 
purpose. Again there is no need to wait for page refreshes to get updates, Times Reader 
would itself refresh the contents continually, without any user input. It keeps 
displaying the last updated time in the top right corner, can browse through pages, 
and user clicks for details on a story take them directly with a nice transition effect, creating that Wow effect.

Here is what I saw on my first run,

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
    <a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Igofzvi0TDM/SgzrjyxkumI/AAAAAAAAE48/et4jx0QLZS4/s1600-h/NewYorkTimes.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Igofzvi0TDM/SgzrjyxkumI/AAAAAAAAE48/et4jx0QLZS4/s400/NewYorkTimes.JPG"></a>
</div>

Try it and let the world know of your opinion.

Unlike its predecessor, Times Reader 2.0 is built over Adobe AIR technology which 
enables it over Windows, Macintosh and your favorite flavor of Linux, as opposed to 
the earlier WPF version that was restricted to Windows.

I wish something similar is developed by the `Times of India`, for they already have 
an e-paper edition which kind of sucks. Rise India, leverage technology to show prowess 
to the world.
