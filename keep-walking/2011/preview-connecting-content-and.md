**Jay Dutta**, Experience Design Manager and **Luanne Seymour**, Sr. Instructional Designer at

community in the cloud at <a href="http://max.adobe.com/attend">Adobe MAX 2011</a>.

As mentioned for the video,

>    See how a few simple UX design patterns can facilitate a shared, social learning experience 
>    that blurs the boundaries between inspiration and instruction, as well as between content and 
>    community. Three trends are currently sweeping digital media: Tablets are moving from content 
>    consumption to creation, social features are increasingly pervasive, and everything is shifting 
>    to the cloud. Join us to explore how this trifecta creates exciting opportunities for designers 
>    and developers, and to examine our own promising effort at taking advantage of these trends.
