Yesterday a very dear friend of mine, <a href="http://rajat.ahuja.name/blog/about-rajat">Rajat 
Ahuja</a> suggested me to add a <b>Facebook Like</b> or a <b>Google +1</b> button to the blog 
so that sharing becomes easy. As this was something I had turned off a while back, bringing it 
in was not so tough. Hence, from just now all over my blog the following 3 buttons will appear 
along with the usual <b>ReTweet</b> button,

<!-- break here -->

* Facebook Like button
* Google Buzz button
* Google +1 button

I might turn off the `Google Buzz` button, again, due to my personal aversion to its color combination :)

Thanks a lot, **Rajat** for the suggestion.
