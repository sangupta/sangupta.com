Wow! Thats what I can say about this acquisition. So very soon we will have games 
for free, and that too some really simple and cool games. I am looking forward 
to what they are gonna offer. Very little to say at this point, but what I surely 
believe is that Microsoft has stiff competition from the number-cruching company 
that is making the computing world a better place to be in.
