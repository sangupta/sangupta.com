Life is so busy these days, we rarely get time to pursue our dreams. Ideas keep 
coming in our minds, we keep planning every small detail, then throwing them 
into corners of our mind.

<!-- break here -->

Same with me, posts lurking in the draft mode, thousands of lines of code waiting 
to be checked in, many emails to be replied to. Today, as I put finishing touches 
to one my latest projects, I hope to get more time to pursue things pending.

Now to the project, MATRIKA India! 
<a href="http://www.matrika-india.org" title="MATRIKA India">MATRIKA India</a>, 
is a NGO (Non-Government Organization, _for dummies_) involved in preservation of 
traditional birth knowledge. MATRIKA, short for Motherhood and Traditional Resources, 
Information, Knowledge and Action; stands to spread the traditional knowhow and 
act as a knowledge repository. You may click 
<a href="http://www.matrika-india.org/AboutUs.html" title="About MATRIKA">here</a> or 
<a href="http://www.matrika-india.org/WhyMatrika.html" title="Why MATRIKA?">here</a> to 
know more about what they do.

The site has been up for the past 8 months or so. Initially it catered to static content, 
but going forth from here, it would cater better to the users needs. We now have an 
integrated search, user registration, feedback, and yes, more about the books, literature 
and video clips to cover the subject. The site has been updated with many more articles, 
research papers, video clips for you to read, watch and download. We hope that this would 
help in generating much more interest on the subject.

The challenging part of this project was ASP.NET. This is the first website that I have 
put together in ASP.NET. Prior to this my whole development world was around Java, or 
using .NET to develop desktop applications. Putting up an integrated search engine was 
a challenge, as there are practically no code examples that integrate using a crawler 
and search engine for a web application. I am more than happy to have been successful 
with that.

me to know, as to how we can improve your experience on the website.
