The post shows that Yahoo Mail is gonna give us infinte Email space from May 2007 
onwards. You think its a sort of first: NOT REALLY!!! <a href="http://rediff.com">Rediff.com</a> 
a portal from India, is already making available unlimited size email boxes for the past few months. 
Even they are not the first. <a href="http://indiatimes.com">Indiatimes.com</a> another portal 
from India, has been giving infinte capacity for quite a long time now. And if you are thinking 
about what makes them possible to do so, and you are narroowing on the fact that they might not 
have a large user base, then you might need to think again. Being in India, I know that there 
is a real large population that uses <a href="http://mail.rediff.com">RediffMail</a> 
and <a href="http://mail.indiatimes.com">IndiaTimes Mail</a>.

<!-- break here -->

As somewhere on the Net I read, that most of the users are never using more than 50% of the 
available limit on both <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">Yahoo</a> and <a href="http://hotmail.com">Hotmail</a>, 
and for <a href="http://mail.google.com/">Google</a> the figure stands at 40%. (I can't find the link to 
the post) So, if we accept the fact then it means that these users are definitely not using their 
Email accounts for dumping things and/or they are not receiving that much mail.

I am myself a very heavy user of <a href="http://mail.google.com/">Gmail</a> (before that a 
very heavy user of Hotmail). But then and now, always I keep checking my account size, and 
whenever it raises above 1000MB I clean it out. I clean it not because I find the size of 
account growing, but because so much of forwarded junk and useless messages (emails rendered 
useless because of time such as reminders etc.) make my account cluttered, and when you are 
fishing for that unique message, you find yourself stuck up in a junk pool.

Two days later happens to be 1st April 2007, and as the trend has been with Google, they always 
announce something special for Gmail on this day. I wonder if they are gonna do something same. 
But can they surpass Yahoo this time? Only time can tell, and I am myself eagerly waiting for 
things to come out. Best of luck to Yahoo! and Google... and to all us... USERS!!!
