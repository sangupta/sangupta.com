Any Internet user searching for some information would definitely know the importance 
of navigation menus. Mostly, across the <em>world wide web</em> we would find the top 
navigational bar and the left navigational menu.

In the early days of Internet, the websites used to have some important links as their 
menu. But, as the Internet technology grew, and with the advent of JavaScript, hierarchal 
menus were born. This was one way of accommodating more links in less space.

Every website developer tends to create such navigational menus using JavaScript. But it 
has an inherent disadvantage. Browsers without JavaScript (or disabled) will not render 
the menu. In recent times, the security perspective has also threatened the use of JavaScript 
menus. Also, JavaScript menus tend to be heavier.

With the proliferation of CSS technology, and its adoption by almost every browser it has 
become simple and easy to have hierarchal menus based on CSS. Using just simple plain list 
created by using nested &lt;ul&gt; and &lt;li&gt; tags, one can create those flashy menus.

For light-weight CSS based menus look at the <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/dropdowns/">Suckerfish

Hope this helps!
