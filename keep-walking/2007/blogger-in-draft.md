Google has just invieled the draft version of some new features to come up in the 
blogger including uploading of videos. Check it out at

<!-- break here -->

I just tried using the upload video function and its just great. It uploads your 
video to Google videos and embeds the link directly in the post. Bye Bye to all 
thsoe Myspace and youtube hacks.
