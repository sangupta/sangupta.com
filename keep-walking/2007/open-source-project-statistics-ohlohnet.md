`Ohloh.net` seems to be a great tool for finding out the statistics of an open-source 
project. I was browsing through the <a href="http://www.icsharpcode.com/">SharpDevelop 
website</a>, when I happened to look at a counter displaying all sorts of summary - lines 
of code, developers, cost, time spent, licensing model, activity percentage. I was attracted 
to the counter in the first glance. This was something unusual in the world of **badges** 
where we find more of them representing the technology used, the target technology and the 
projects that power the service.

<!-- break here -->

This was a counter that was not about itself, it was about the project that I was interested 
in. I clicked on the counter, and what opened was a magicians box. With loads of information, 
and a wealth of statistics, the dashboard was analyzing this open-source project, and 
estimating various metrics.

ohloh.net displays the following information about a project,

* languages used in the project
* lines of code including/excluding markups
* effort time in man years
* projected cost
* license usage
* history of the codebase
* developers effort in the project


and more... You can look at the <a href="http://www.ohloh.net/projects/3544">statistics for 
SharpDevelop here</a>. Great going folks, I have checked the badge and found it good, now 
next I will have a badge of my own, one day..surely, one day!
