<div style="text-align: justify;">
    I was one day pondering over the features provided by Wordpress,. I came across this theme called Foliage. The theme was too cool to catch my attention. I was immediately left searching for a blogger version. If any like-minded person would have done the honors of copy-cat, and to my cheers, YES. I found the copy at 
    <a href="http://www.bloggertemplates.org/review/foliage">http://www.bloggertemplates.org/review/foliage</a>. I downloaded it immediately, but to my disappointment the theme was in the old blogger format.
    <br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-style: italic;">Hats off for the original creators and modifiers. Thanks a lot!<br></span>

    </blockquote>Now the daunting task, of searching for the new version. Days of search ended in a ZERO. Ahh... I would need to convert the theme myself.
    <br>
    <br>I started the conversion a few weeks back, but the hectic schedule of the office makes it difficult. Anyways, it was a free weekend and I have done most of it. There are only some small tweaks left. Hopefully, I would be able to complete them soon too.
    <br>
    <br>Catch a glimpse of the 
    <a href="http://foliage-in-xml.blogspot.com/">new theme here</a>.
    <br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-style: italic;">PS: The theme is a modified version of the original Foliage theme. </span>As soon as I am done with complete modifications and optimizations, I would make the theme open to you all.
