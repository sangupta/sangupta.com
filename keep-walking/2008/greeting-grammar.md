Do you feel there is something wrong is saying, "Hi Sandeep". If you DO NOT I would suggest 
you to read this particular post by Bob, <a href="http://crazybob.org/2008/07/greeting-grammar.html">Greeting 
Grammar</a>, which is definitely an eye opener. Its an amazing post which reminds me of my 
grade school classes. Gosh, if only I had paid some heed to my teachers. :)
