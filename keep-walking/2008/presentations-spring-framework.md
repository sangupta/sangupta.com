I have just finished updating the **Spring Presentations** for Version 2.5 and 
am happy to announce that they are now available in the public domain. You may 
know more and download the presentations from <a href="http://code.google.com/p/azcarya/wiki/SpringFramework">here</a>. 
There are two presentations covering the <a href="http://azcarya.googlecode.com/files/Spring%20Basics.ppsx">Basics</a> and 
the <a href="http://azcarya.googlecode.com/files/Spring%20Abstractions.ppsx">Enterprise Service 
Abstractions</a>.

An online preview would be available shortly.

Hope this helps!
