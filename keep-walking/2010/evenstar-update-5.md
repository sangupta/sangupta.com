What use writing a blogging system if I can't use it for my own thoughts, right? And 
with all the more so into blogging, I can't expect to start something new. I will thus 
have to migrate all my blogs to `Evenstar`, sooner or later. How to do that blazingly 
fast? Can't even think of posting each and every post manually - that would be suicidal.

<!-- break here -->

Thus, the only option left is a blog importer. With the option being common in every 
day's blogging system, it is all the more easy. Thus, I went ahead and coded a blog 
importer in `Evenstar`. Yes, you read it right - to start with `Evenstar` can now import 
blogs from `Blogger`. And it is too simple. 

* Get into Blogger
* Export your blog as an XML
* Login to Evenstar
* Import the XML

And there you have, all the blogs, labels, and comments right into `Evenstar`. Nothing more to do.

Hope this would help making `Evenstar` a better system. I know you guys are awaiting it to be 
available for deployment, just hang on, a couple of more days! I promise!

As always, Welcome to **Evenstar**, <i>where dreams come true</i>!
