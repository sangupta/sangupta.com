A concept video by Cullen Dudas running on Windows 7 under the code name `Copenhagen`. 
User interface designer Cullen Dudas doesn't work at Microsoft. Yet. But from the looks 
of this stunning demo of his Copenhagen User Experience design concept, Microsoft might 
want to hire him before someone else does. Could this be a first look at Windows 8?

When Cullen first began working on Copenhagen, he started with a question

> How could one reenergize, reinvigorate the very essence and soul of Windows?

Must say creativity at its best. Though I love the music much more :)


For the interested: The song is known as `With A Spirit` by `Alexander Perl's "009 Sound System`.
