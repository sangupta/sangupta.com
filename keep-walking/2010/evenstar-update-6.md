50 days since I started on this journey, I am glad to say that today I can take some rest. Today, 
`Evenstar` reaches its first milestone. Yes, `Evenstar` is now in running session. And to showcase
the same, I moved one of my favorite blogs to be powered by `Evenstar`. But, the final destination 
is far away. One day of rest, and then I embark further to make Evenstar, a place where dreams come true.

<!-- break here -->

Go ahead and check out my creations running on my creation. 
<a href="http://www.poetinside.com/">PoetInside</a>, my poetry blog, is now powered by 
`Evenstar`.

For the interested, the code is available at <a href="https://jerry.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/jerry/JerryNext/evenstar/">https://jerry.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/jerry/JerryNext/evenstar/</a>. Downloadable deployable WAR coming soon!

I want to pen something special for Evenstar, but I can't resist posting this too, so here are just a couple of them,

>    <i>Evenstar is a tribute,<br>tribute to the spirit of you,<br>I welcome you to Evenstar,<br>where dreams come true!<br></i>

And yes, don't forget to login and see the restricted post feature in action. Hurray!!!
