Finally I could find some time to work on Evenstar again, two weeks after 
we discovered some bugs. I just happened to fix the bug related to user 
permission where-in a user with permission was not able to view the post 
that was restricted to certain users. The bug was specifically related 
to some OpenID function which I messed up.

The fix is in and you could get the latest code at <a href="https://jerry.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/jerry/JerryNext/evenstar/">https://jerry.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/jerry/JerryNext/evenstar/</a>

The latest code base is now deployed on PoetInside and is running good. I 
just tested adding an Open ID account of mine from Blogger, and it works 
perfect!

Keep exploring folks! Cheers!
