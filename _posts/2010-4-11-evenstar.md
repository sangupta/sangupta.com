Evenstar
--------

you are the beginning, you are the end
you the fragrance, you my life's essence

a glimpse of you, eases all my pain
your innocence, forces the sun to rain

a journey I make, path hidden from me
I will not falter, the shining star leads me

cloud of doubts hunt, the hope eludes
in those haunting dreams, lie the clues

will never wax and wane, the light of elindir
purifies the heart, in darkness, is my seer

memories I remember, when together we stand
your hand on my heart, induces in strength

to all my promises, I will hold afar
as my heart follows you, Arwen Evenstar!
