Sometime back I happened to work with `JOpenSurf` project for some prototypign work. The project is also a dependency
of the `LIRE` project, the popular Lucene based Image Retrieval library. The only drawback if the `JOpenSurf` project
was its non-availability in Maven Central.

I took time and am pleased to announce that the library is now available in Maven Central. Feel free to include it
in your code as:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.sangupta</groupId>
    <artifactId>jopensurf</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```

Hope this helps.
