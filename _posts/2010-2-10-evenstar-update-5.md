    What use writing a blogging system if I can't use it for my own thoughts, right? And with all the more so into blogging, I can't expect to start something new. I will thus have to migrate all my blogs to 
    <b>Evenstar</b>, sooner or later. How to do that blazingly fast? Can't even think of posting each and every post manually - that would be suicidal.
    <br>
    <br>Thus, the only option left is a blog importer. With the option being common in every day's blogging system, it is all the more easy. Thus, I went ahead and coded a blog importer in 
    <b>Evenstar</b>. Yes, you read it right - to start with 
    <b>Evenstar</b> can now import blogs from Blogger. And it is too simple. Get into Blogger, export your blog as an XML. Login to 
    <b>Evenstar</b>, and import the XML. And there you have, all the blogs, labels, and comments right into 
    <b>Evenstar</b>. Nothing more to do.
    <br>
    <br>Hope this would help making 
    <b>Evenstar </b>a better system. I know you guys are awaiting it to be available for deployment, just hang on, a couple of more days! I promise!
    <br>
    <br>As always, Welcome to 
    <b>Evenstar</b>, 
    <i>where dreams come true</i>!
