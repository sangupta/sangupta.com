Wooo Hooo... GMAIL has raised its attachments limit to 20 MB. This means more music, more 
masti and more fun. Since Google started giving out 2 GB of mail box, the attachment limit 
of 10MB has always been a pain. A small presentation of even 100 slides, many a times 
exceeds out 10MB. But now, I am sure my mailbox is gonna fill up soon.

Thanks Google... once again!
