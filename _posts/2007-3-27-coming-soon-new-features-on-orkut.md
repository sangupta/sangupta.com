Just found a list of new features the Orkut team is currently working
<br>
<br>
<ul>
    <li>Allow posting more than 12 photos in an album</li>
    <li>Restrict the copy and paste functions on photos</li>
    <li>Allow me to change colors and layout of my profile</li>
    <li>Add Blog features</li>
    <li>Keep profile out of search results</li>
    <li>Polls already there on communities with members less than 50 and will there for all after few days<br></li>
</ul>Found these on Orkut Help ... so they are true.
<br>
<br>The Google/Orkut team is going crazy. Add more punch to your online life.
<br>
