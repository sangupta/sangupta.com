Just found a list of new features the Orkut team is currently working

* Allow posting more than 12 photos in an album
* Restrict the copy and paste functions on photos
* Allow me to change colors and layout of my profile
* Add Blog features
* Keep profile out of search results
* Polls already there on communities with members less than 50 and will there for all after few days

Found these on Orkut Help ... so they are true.

The Google/Orkut team is going crazy. Add more punch to your online life.

Have a great time folks!!!
