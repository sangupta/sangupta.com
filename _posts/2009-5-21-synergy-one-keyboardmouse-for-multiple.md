    Many of us use multiple computers at work, most probably, a laptop and the desktop. And most of the time we find ourselves wondering as to why the cursor isn't moving with the mouse, only to realize that we were using the wrong keyboard/mouse combination. Sounds familiar, huh? I have been irritated by this a lot in the past, and recently, I discovered this magical tool which left me cursing as to why I didn't discover it earlier.
    <br>
    <br>
    <a href="http://synergy2.sourceforge.net">Synergy</a>, an open source tool that seems to be doing magic. In its own words,
    <br>
    <blockquote>
        Synergy lets you easily share a single mouse and keyboard between multiple computers with different operating systems, each with its own display, without special hardware. It's intended for users with multiple computers on their desk since each system uses its own monitor(s). 
    </blockquote>
    <br>Yes, it really does that. In reality, as soon as I configured this tool, this is the first post I am making using the other screen and smiling :) Configuration in super easy - it was over under 2 minutes and now I have the pleasure of cleaning up my office desk of all those useless wires. I can now only have multiple screens with a single pair of keyboard and mouse and work seamlessly. How easy, isn't it?
    <br>
    <br>Another major power of the tool is to bring the 
    <b>universal clipboard</b> into existence. You want to copy from one computer to another, simply, copy from the screen of the first, move keyboard to second, and paste. Voilla - its simpler than buying an ice-cream. Enjoy!!!
    <br>
    <br>Are you left gasping for more? Here it comes... 
    <i><span style="font-weight:bold;">Screensaver's</span></i> on all computers are in sync. They start at the same time and end at the same time. Amazing - yes atleast for me.
    <br>
    <br>In anticipation that some fellow world citizen might easy his/her pain with this tool. 
    <b>Hail Synergy, Hail the power of Open-Source!!!</b>
