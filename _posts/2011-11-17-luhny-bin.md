Two days ago, 
<a href="http://blog.crazybob.org/">Bob Lee</a> posted a fun challenge on the 
<a href="http://blog.crazybob.org/2011/11/coding-challenge-luhny-bin.html">Luhny Bin</a>. It was not before a day has passed that I could get to know of the problem and try my hands at it. The delay being attributed to absence of 
<b>Cygwin</b> on my Windows machine which was needed to run the test harness (refer original post on details).
<br>
<br>Yesterday, I spent most of my time first trying to get the harness running without using Cygwin. The solution was a bit tricky as I had to figure out how the test harness was actually running. Anyhow, my solution is available at 
<a href="https://github.com/sangupta/luhnybin/blob/master/src/com/squareup/luhnybin/Main.java">here</a> wherein I modified the original 
<tt>Main.java</tt> file. The change was simple: first, change 
<tt>mask.sh</tt> on line 
<tt>41</tt> to say 
<tt>mask.bat</tt> and second, modify line 
<tt>81</tt> to correctly build the process.
<br>
<br>Once, I had it setup and after loosing all day, I was ready to start coding the actual solution. Before I dozed off to my bed, I had made sure that my code passed 18 of the 20 tests. The 
<b>19th test</b> was tricky. It had many over-lapping 
<tt>luhn</tt> numbers, and hence I had some leftover in the end which was not being cleaned up. This single test made me completely rewrite the piece introducing a third buffer (which came down to two, as I directly now wrote to 
<tt>System.out</tt>).
<br>
<br>Anyways, the solution is now complete and posted on my fork of the 
<a href="https://github.com/sangupta/luhnybin">LuhnyBin Github</a> repository.
