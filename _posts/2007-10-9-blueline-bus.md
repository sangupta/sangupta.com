Standing in the middle of the road, don't make such a fuss,
<br>
Get to a safer side, before comes the blueline bus!
<br><br>
Police can book errant drivers, vehicles can be impound,
<br>
Yet, the charm of big money, has their conscience bound!
<br><br>
Even a hundred deaths, could not shake the minister,
<br>
For the one who died, was not his brother or sister!
<br><br>
Hence, killers are back on road, till today 82 out of 87,
<br>
Only advice for all of us, look for a safe haven!
