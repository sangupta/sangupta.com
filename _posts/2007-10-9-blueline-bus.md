Blueline Bus
------------

Standing in the middle of the road, don't make such a fuss,
Get to a safer side, before comes the blueline bus!

Police can book errant drivers, vehicles can be impound,
Yet, the charm of big money, has their conscience bound!

Even a hundred deaths, could not shake the minister,
For the one who died, was not his brother or sister!

Hence, killers are back on road, till today 82 out of 87,
Only advice for all of us, look for a safe haven!
