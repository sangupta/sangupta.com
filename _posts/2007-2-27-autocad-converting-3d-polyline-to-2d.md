<p>Almost all who are working in the field of engineering design and are using AutoCAD as their primary CAD software would have felt the need to convert a 3D polyline to a 2D polyline. In the field of Civil Engineering, survey drawings consists of hundreds, if not thousands, of 3D polylines. But a designer needs to convert them to 2D model to work and plan on that.</p> 
<p>It's a pity that AutoCAD (already into Release 18) has still not addressed this problem, and given a ready-to-use command. If they would have it would have been a boon for engineers. Most of us use some sort of customized scripts to acheive the job, and for those who do not do so already, here below is a LISP script which you can use to your free-will to do this haunting task.</p> 
<p>Download the <a href="http://sandy.pec.googlepages.com/3d2d.lsp.txt">LISP code from here</a>.</p> 
<p>Load the script into AutoCAD and type <strong>d32</strong>, and select the 3D polyline. Voilla! its done! Yes, that's all you need to do.</p> 
<p>Happy drafting.</p>
