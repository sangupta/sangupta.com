Here is another interesting service from <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a>. Want 
to know, which movie is being showed in which theater at what time? Just enter your city 
name and watch all the movie shows with current timings on your screen.

You taking it as a joke, try yourself: <a href="http://www.google.co.in/movies">http://www.google.co.in/movies</a>

Happy Googling into movies!
