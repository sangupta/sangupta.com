```
Why does it happen, Why?
At the peak of your career,
You realize, Time flew by,
Leaving you secluded to cry!

Friends expect you to celebrate,
For them, You just won the toss,
Deep inside yourself, You evaluate,
What you gained, What was lost!

Aloof in the company of many,
Colleagues, Friends and Family,
The Fun, The Excitement, The Wishes,
With every passing moment, Diminish!

You want to be all alone,
To regain your ground,
In the inner emotional cyclone,
Fighting those voices profound!

You find no angel nearby,
To console your bleeding soul,
On whom you could rely!!
Why does it happen, Why?
```
