I just read a news in my feeds from 
<a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a>. They have just launched a complete version of 
<a href="http://news.google.com/news?ned=hi_in">Google News in Hindi</a>. Wow! That's amazing. 
As usual, I clicked on the link, and I was taken to the webpage. It looks stunning.

I was expecting some stale news, as there are not many channels out there, but was pleased 
to find almost the same articles, as they were on the English version. The only negative 
aspect was the font. I did not find it too clear. It seems to be a little blurred.

But still, I am pleased to find the news site in my mother tongue. Keep up the good work, Google!
