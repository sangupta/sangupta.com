They say,

>    Change is the only constant.

How true this is, we realize as we keep walking down the lane of our life.

Today, happens to be one such change. Today, I have started migrating all code from various repositories that held my code, such as 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jerry/">Source Forge</a>, 
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/sangupta">Google Code</a> and other locally hosted ones, to their new home - 
<a href="https://github.com/organizations/myjerry">Github</a>.

This is one single consolidation effort where in I want all my code to be available 
publicly, be of good quality and above all - clean up my systems. Keeping their backups 
have already become nightmare for me. I anticipate this to take around 2 weeks, so keep 
watching for more posts under the label, <b>myjerry</b>.

Stay tuned, for more blog posts on how to reuse all this shit of code ;)

Keep Walking!
