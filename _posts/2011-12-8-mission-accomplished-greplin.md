After a lull yesterday, I could finally find time to solve the third puzzle in the 
<a href="http://challenge.greplin.com/">Greplin Programming Challenge</a>. At first 
the puzzle seemed tricky, considering my bad with combinatory logic with numbers. However 
after many trials and errors I could solve the puzzle. And now I can sit and relax, and 
look at my stupid face as to why I was writing over 100 lines of code to solve, when the
solution was simply a few lines.

Anyways, am done with the challenge and I have my passcode now! Next steps involve dropping 
them a mail with my solutions.

For those interested, the code is available on <a href="https://github.com/sangupta/greplin">my GitHub repository</a>.

Happy Coding!
