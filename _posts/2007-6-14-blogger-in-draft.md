Google has just invieled the draft version of some new features to come up in the blogger including uploading of videos. Check it out at

<br>
<br>I just tried using the upload video function and its just great. It uploads your video to Google videos and embeds the link directly in the post. Bye Bye to all thsoe Myspace and youtube hacks.
