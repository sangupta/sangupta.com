Best of Luck!!!
---------------

With these verses I send 
thousand white roses hand plucked
to brighten up your day
wishing you immense luck

O beautiful, listen to my words
time has come to prove yourself up
for you to spread your magical shine
and win the world with your captivating smile

rediscover the parental genetic gift
laugh off your aches and silly ways
you have worked hard for it
and today is your special day

live your heart, speak your mind
hold your confidence right
and am sure, you will twinkle
brighter than the stars bright!
