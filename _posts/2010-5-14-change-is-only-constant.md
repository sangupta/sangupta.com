A wise man once said, **Change is the only constant!** And today is the day of the 
change. This blog has a new home, `http://blog.sangupta.com`; a new theme with some 
new colors; and a new name, **sangupta**.

`sangupta` has been my user id in the online world, and hence, it sticks.

The code pieces have a new home as well, <a href="http://code.google.com/p/sangupta">http://code.google.com/p/sangupta</a>.

I plan to put much more new content and thoughts that I encounter each day while playing with code. 

Keep Walking and Play Code!
