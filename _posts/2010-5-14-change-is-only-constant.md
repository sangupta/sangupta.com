A wise man once said, 
<b>Change is the only constant!</b> And today is the day of the change. This blog has a new home, 
<i><b>http://blog.sangupta.com</b></i>; a new theme with some new colors; and a new name, 
<b><u>sangupta</u></b>. 
<b>sangupta</b> has been my user id in the online world, and hence, it sticks.
<br>
<br>The code pieces have a new home as well, 
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/sangupta">http://code.google.com/p/sangupta</a>.
<br>
<br>I plan to put much more new content and thoughts that I encounter each day while playing with code. 
<br>
<br>Keep Walking and Play Code!
