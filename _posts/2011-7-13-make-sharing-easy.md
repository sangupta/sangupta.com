Yesterday a very dear friend of mine, 
<a href="http://rajat.ahuja.name/blog/about-rajat">Rajat Ahuja</a> suggested me to add a 
<b>Facebook Like</b> or a 
<b>Google +1</b> button to the blog so that sharing becomes easy. As this was something I had turned off a while back, bringing it in was not so tough. Hence, from just now all over my blog the following 3 buttons will appear along with the usual 
<b>ReTweet</b> button,
<br>
<ul>
    <li>Facebook Like button</li>
    <li>Google Buzz button</li>
    <li>Google +1 button</li>
</ul>
<br>I might turn off the 
<tt>Google Buzz</tt> button, again, due to my personal aversion to its color combination :)
<br>
<br>Thanks a lot, 
<b>Rajat</b> for suggestion.
