Recently, I had a requirement wherein the client wanted to edit data from a table using a grid that would be editable, sortable, paginated, with column resizing and column locking. Anyone with a .NET background would say, quite easy. But, what if you had to implement all these features in Java? This was a real challenge, for I had never in my life came across such a thing in Java. I had heard of a few libraries out there in OS (Open-source) but nothing could come even close to it. So what was the solution?
<br>
<br>Google - was the starting point. A quick search revealed 
<a href="http://displaytag.sourceforge.net/">DisplayTags</a>. As it says, 
<i>"Give it a list of objects and it will handle column display, sorting, paging, cropping, grouping, exporting, smart linking and decoration of a table in a customizable XHTML style"</i>. I digged deeper and found that it could not provide all the features, I was looking for. But, yes it had most of them. A quick download and a setup in Tomcat was all what I needed. The samples included made it quite easy to understand. I was on my way implementing it, when I banged across a rock. It could not be used with inline frames. Ahhh - what an architecture of the application!
<br>
<br>Now what? Searched and searched and searched. Even coded a paginating grid for the purpose. Then went on to struggle with CSS and DIV to freeze a specified column. Lots of hit and trial combinations lead to partial success. Implemented server-side sorting, ok the application would be an internal intranet applcation - so I didn't much bother. But how about column resizing. Can that be achieved? I gave up - and even my client.
<br>
<br>Somehow to my luck I came across the Yahoo User Interface library (YUI) and 
<a href="http://www.extjs.com">ExtJS</a>, its extensions. The demo on the homepage were good enough to knock me out of my seat. The 
<a href="http://extjs.com/deploy/dev/examples/grid/edit-grid.html">editable grid</a> and 
<a href="http://extjs.com/deploy/dev/examples/grid/paging.html">paginating grid</a> samples drew a conclusion - I had to use this. It was mesmerizing and simply wonderful! A few more samples unleash the power of ExtJS like the 
<a href="http://extjs.com/deploy/dev/examples/desktop/desktop.html">Desktop</a> and the 
<a href="http://extjs.com/deploy/dev/examples/feed-viewer/view.html">Feed Viewer</a>
<br>
<br>Coding the grid was a bit uneasy at first as not much documentation is available at the beginners level. Once you are done with the initial docs, it's a breeze. For reasons better understood, I cannot provide the code and explanatory notes here.
