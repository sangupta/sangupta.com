I have recently started using the Google Analytics for web traffic analysis for one of 
my projects. Previously using AWStats the difference in two is quite noticeable. It seems 
like take a giant leap from DOS to Windows Vista.

Google Analytics is free for everyone who has a hit count of 5 million page view per month 
or less. That is more than sufficient for every person like you and me. Neither our website 
nor our blogs get that much hits.

Google Analytics was formerly <em>Urchin </em>until they were purchased by Google. It was 
formerly not free, but months after acquiring them Google opened it up to the world. Presumably 
to help drive people to use Adwords since it ties in with Analytics so well. Google Analytics 
is the most powerful free application. It provides a wealth of statistics, a usable interface, 
and a lot of ecommerce statistics which are not common in free applications. It’s tie in 
with Adwords is handy if you do a lot of advertising there. It also uses a javascript tag to 
report the data so you’re not dealing with hosting your own logfiles. The downside is that 
the data is often 12 hours behind, so it’s not useful for looking at up to the minute stats. 
But still, the details it provides are worth the wait.

Some more web traffic analysis tools I am exploring have been

* StatCounter
* QuantCast
* MeasureMap
* SiteMeter
* DeepMetrix

Currently, exploring the pros and cons of each, will publish a detailed comparison soon.
