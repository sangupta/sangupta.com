_One fine day, a friend wrote, *Tomorrow will be bright and will bring new light...* and started it all!_

I wake up every day,
in the anticipation of light,
but even searching all lengths,
I still can't find my way!

**[...]**

I wander not for the light
but for the star
which can brighten my life
heal my scars!

**[...]**

Shadows are they
and not dark patches
follow me everywhere
and at times almost catches.

I fight not to be alive
but to live a dream
its the elf queen's halo
that brings me to light.

the fate is bound
of you and me
to the one ring
that cannot be found.
