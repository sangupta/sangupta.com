<p>As we all know, Flash Builder (earlier Flex Builder) is based on Eclipse RCP, lacks rich XML editing capabilities which are needed for almost all projects, except the <em>Hello World!</em> kinds. For those who have used Eclipse, would agree that the Eclipse platform has a feature-rich built-in XML editing capabilities. It is easy to use the same capabilities in Flash Builder as well.</p> 
<p>To install the plugin, launch your Flash Builder and then choose Help –&gt; Install New Software. Add the following location to the list of ‘Available Software Sites’, <a title="http://download.eclipse.org/releases/galileo/" href="http://download.eclipse.org/releases/galileo/">http://download.eclipse.org/releases/galileo/</a> for Flash Builder 4.0, and click OK. Choose the site in the drop down, and wait for the list to populate. Once the list has populated, choose <strong>‘Eclipse XML Editors and Tools’</strong> and click on Install. Restart your workbench, and, you are done. </p> 
<p>Hope this helps.</p>
