Today at <a href="http://max.adobe.com">MAX 2011</a>, Adobe 
<a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/flashplayer/2011/10/adobe-flash-player-11-air-11-available-later-today.html">released</a> the 
latest version of their Flash platform SDKs - Flash Player 11 and AIR 3.0. The most noticeable 
and exciting amongst 
<a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/flashplatform/2011/09/announcing-flash-player-11-and-air-3.html">new features 
of AIR 3.0</a> is the introduction of 
<a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/air/articles/extending-air.html">Native Extensions</a>. Native Extensions 
allow a developer to extend the capabilities of the AIR platform by running native code directly from their 
AIR applications. Quoting from Adobe's site,

<blockquote>
    This new capability allows developers to:
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>Achieve deeper integration with target devices</li>
        <li>Incorporate legacy native code in their application</li>
        <li>Achieve maximum performance for critical code</li>
    </ul>
</blockquote>

I am not going to delve into what the feature introduces a developer to, for the same one may go ahead and read this
