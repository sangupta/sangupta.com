<a href="http://www.microsoft.com">Microsoft</a> has agreed to donate funds to two charity organizations when people use Windows Live Search to search for data. This is something they should have started well before. But its not too late ever.
<br>
<br>They are funding 
<a href="http://click4thecause.live.com/search/charity/default.aspx">NineMillions.org</a> and 
<a href="http://teamseattle.live.com/Search/Charity/TeamSeattle/Default.aspx">Team Seattle</a>. For every search the user performs using the specific URLs, MS will fund the two organizations. 
<a href="http://nine-million.spaces.live.com/">NineMillions.org</a> as I stated before is a UN program to fund the education of reguee youth. 
<a href="http://www.teamseattle.com/">Team Seattle</a> is an organization funding the Children's Hospital.
<br>

<a href="http://teamseattle.live.com/Search/Charity/TeamSeattle/Default.aspx">http://teamseattle.live.com/Search/Charity/TeamSeattle/Default.aspx</a>
<br>
<br>Use the above URLs to access the pages for the two.
<br>
<br>I am going to use MS Live search for helping these missions. I request you to do the same.
