<b>Jay Dutta</b>, Experience Design Manager and 
<b>Luanne Seymour</b>, Sr. Instructional Designer at 
<a href="http://www.adobe.com">Adobe</a> presented a Social Study on how to connect content and community in the cloud at 
<a href="http://max.adobe.com/attend">Adobe MAX 2011</a>.
<br>As mentioned for the video,
<br>
<blockquote>
    See how a few simple UX design patterns can facilitate a shared, social learning experience that blurs the boundaries between inspiration and instruction, as well as between content and community. Three trends are currently sweeping digital media: Tablets are moving from content consumption to creation, social features are increasingly pervasive, and everything is shifting to the cloud. Join us to explore how this trifecta creates exciting opportunities for designers and developers, and to examine our own promising effort at taking advantage of these trends.
