Finally, my dream has started taking its shape. As promised in my earlier post, here comes the first preview of 
<a href="http://myjerry.org/evenstar.html">Evenstar</a>. Catch evenstar live at 
<a href="http://stage.myjerry.org">http://stage.myjerry.org</a>. The blog system in general is fully functional with some of the features pending wiring, and a few nice touches remaining, including building a beautiful but fast enough theme.
<br>
<br>For the curious the following still need to be perfected. Any help on the same is most welcome.
<br>
<ul>
    <li>Importing from Blogger is still somewhat broken</li>
    <li>Email service is not yet wired</li>
    <li>Feed service is not yet done - so no feeds from the blog</li>
    <li>Performance Optimization - we still make a lot of DB hits which can be reduced.</li>
    <li>Security is another area, where I need to work upon</li>
</ul>Go ahead guys, try it out and let me know of issues you find. You may download the code for GAE and deploy it yourself. Code can be found at 
<a href="https://jerry.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/jerry/JerryNext/evenstar/">https://jerry.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/jerry/JerryNext/evenstar/</a>. The code makes use of GAE SDK 1.3.0 and runs using Java 6. I have not tested this with Java 5, but it should work. Anyhow, with GAE supporting both Java 5 and Java 6, it should be a problem.
<br>
<br>Wishing all a very Happy and Prosperous, year 2010!
<br>
<br>Welcome to Evenstar, where dreams come true!
