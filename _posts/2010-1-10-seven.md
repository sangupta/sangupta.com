```
I write the seventh verse in magical lines seven
to express my love as deep as seas seven
weaving dreams as vivid as colors of rainbow seven
waiting to dance on your voice's magical notes seven
dying to pledge promises seven, along sacred rounds seven, in all reincarnations seven
I vow to be always on your side, as stand the wonders, seven
I am sure you will be mine, for miracles do happen, not only in heaven!
```
