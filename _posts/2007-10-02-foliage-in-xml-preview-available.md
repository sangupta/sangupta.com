Great News! I am done with the original conversion of the <a href="http://foliage-for-blogger.blogspot.com/" 
title="Original Foliage theme for blogger">foliage</a> theme completely to XML. There are slight differences, 
due to blogger changing its API in version 2. The theme is available for preview <a href="http://foliage-in-xml.blogspot.com/" 
title="Modified XML Foliage theme for blogger">here</a>. Links to download the entire theme files, would be 
here by tomorrow.

Please let me know your feedback and comments. I am also working on a modified version on the theme, with 
lots more options like a place for widgets, more bookmark options, calendar based navigation and lots 
more AJAX. So keep pouring in your thoughts.
