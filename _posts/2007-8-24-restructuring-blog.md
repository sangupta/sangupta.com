Its been long since I have posted on this blog of mine. It really sounds a lot disgusting to readers. I am in the process of restructuring all my stuff, my blogs, websites and stuff alike.
<br>
<br>It's Azcarya's turn for now. I am categorizing my blogs so, Azcarya shall be the technical blog, 
<a href="http://poetinside.blogspot.com/">Poet Inside</a> about the music inside me, and 
<a href="http://iliked.blogspot.com/">What I Like...</a> about things I am reading, listening and enjoying.
<br>
<br>A new theme is on the way, along with, lots of discussions on technology usage and examples, mixed with some spice of my own code. Yes, you read it right! I have learnt how to code finally ;)
<br>
<br>It won't be very long before I finish with customizing Azcarya! I promise. Till then you may enjoy 
<a href="http://poetinside.blogspot.com/">Poet Inside</a> or 
<a href="http://iliked.blogspot.com/">What I Like...</a>
<br>
<br>Thanks a ton for your patience.
