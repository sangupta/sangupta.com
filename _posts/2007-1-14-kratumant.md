`Azcarya` is a sanskrit word that as per <em>Capeller's Sanskrit-English Dictionary</em> means 
strange, miraculous; wonder, prodigy.

Why `Azcarya`? I chose `Azcarya` as the blog name, for one the word <strong><em>Blog</em></strong> to me 
seems strange. I personally don't like the word blog, but there are always few downside to every good 
thing. Miraculous, for whosever the person was behind inventing this way of push-button publishing and 
extreme acceptance by the society is really miraculous. Wonder because it has caught the society with such 
a craze, and prodigy, for it is an excellent way to share information with the word.

In other words, it is in no way related to me. I was looking on for a good catchy name for the blog, and 
kept on searching for every catchy name I could think of, for its availability on blogger, I was then 
disheartened. Then while doing some general browsing I found this word `Azcarya`... and its meaning 
simply stunned me. So just stuck to the word.

Hoping to stick to this for a some time.
