I recently read this article which critically analysed the impact of Windows 
Vista Content Protection, a content protection mechanism introduced in the going 
to be released version of the Windows operating system called Vista, in detail.

The article makes an interesting read and is an in-depth source of information about the impact it can have on the computing industry.
