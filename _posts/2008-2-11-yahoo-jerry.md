We all hear about Yahoo! - the center of attraction for ground-searching Microsoft 
in the world of web. The post is not about what is going on these days, or how things 
would change in the near future.

Here in, I trace back the journey of Yahoo! as it evolved. From the official 
<a href="http://docs.yahoo.com/info/misc/history.html" title="Yahoo! History">Yahoo! history</a> 
page, I came to know that Yahoo! started as the `Jerry and David's Guide to the 
World Wide Web`. The name amused as well as stunned me. Why? Three reasons:

* First, This was a startling revelation as I always thought Yahoo! to be somewhat 
synonymous of its coming to existence. A term coined up revolving around founders, 
idea or inspirational sources, with a touch of Japanese funk.

* Second, Jerry happens to be my favorite cartoon character. Anything that has 
the farthest linkage to Jerry - the lovely little sweet friend - catches my perfect 
attention.

* Third, my first open-source attempt with my friends is also known as 
<a href="http://jerry.sourceforge.net" title="Jerry">Jerry</a>.

Hope this amazes you too!
