<p align="justify">We all hear about Yahoo! - the center of attraction for ground-searching Microsoft in the world of web. The post is not about what is going on these days, or how things would change in the near future.<br><br>Here in, I trace back the journey of Yahoo! as it evolved. From the official <a href="http://docs.yahoo.com/info/misc/history.html" title="Yahoo! History">Yahoo! history</a> page, I came to know that Yahoo! started as the <b><i>Jerry and David's Guide to the World Wide Web</i></b>. The name amused as well as stunned me. Why? Three reasons.<br><br>First, This was a startling revelation as I always thought Yahoo! to be somewhat synonymous of its coming to existence. A term coined up revolving around founders, idea or inspirational sources, with a touch of Japanese funk.<br><br>Second, Jerry happens to be my favorite cartoon character. Anything that has the farthest linkage to Jerry - the lovely little sweet friend - catches my perfect attention.<br><br>Third, my first open-source attempt with my friends is also known as <a href="http://jerry.sourceforge.net" title="Jerry">Jerry</a>.<br><br>Hope this amazes you too.<br><br>Cheers!</p>
