A long expected thing: Google Docs & Spreadsheets is arriving in summer. Wow! Now 
we would able to create presentations online, store them, share them, and all that 
for free.... without the need to install any software. We had been expecting this 
addition for quite long now.

The focus now would be: What's Next? Whatever it be.. I know its gonna make my life 
easier. Great work Google & Tonic!
