<p style="text-align: justify;">A long expected thing: Google Docs &amp; Spreadsheets is arriving in summer. Wow! Now we would able to create presentations online, store them, share them, and all that for free.... without the need to install any software. We had been expecting this addition for quite long now.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The focus now would be: What's Next? Whatever it be.. I know its gonna make my life easier. Great work Google &amp; Tonic! </p>
