<p>Wow! Thats what I can say&nbsp;about this acquisition. So very soon we will have games for free, and that too some&nbsp;really simple and cool games. I am looking forward to&nbsp;what they are&nbsp;gonna offer.&nbsp;Very&nbsp;little&nbsp;to say at this point,&nbsp;but&nbsp;what I&nbsp;surely believe is that Microsoft has stiff competition from the number-cruching company that is making the computing world a better place to be in.</p> 
<p>Great work!!!&nbsp;</p>
