<p>Ohloh.net seems to be a great tool for finding out the statistics of an open-source project. I was browsing through the <a href="http://www.icsharpcode.com/">SharpDevelop website</a>, when I happened to look at a counter displaying all sorts of summary - lines of code, developers, cost, time spent, licensing model, activity percentage. I was attracted to the counter in the first glance. This was something unusual in the world of <strong><em>badges</em></strong> where we find more of them representing the technology used, the target technology and the projects that power the service.</p> 
<p>This was a counter that was not about itself, it was about the project that I was interested in. I clicked on the counter, and what opened was a magicians box. With loads of information, and a wealth of statistics, the dashboard was analyzing this open-source project, and estimating various metrics.</p> 
<p>ohloh.net displays the following information about a project,</p> 
<ol> 
    <li>languages used in the project</li> 
    <li>lines of code including/excluding markups</li> 
    <li>effort time in man years</li> 
    <li>projected cost</li> 
    <li>license usage</li> 
    <li>history of the codebase</li> 
    <li>developers effort in the project</li>
</ol> 
<p>and more... You can look at the <a href="http://www.ohloh.net/projects/3544">statistics for SharpDevelop here</a>. Great going folks, I have checked the badge and found it good, now next I will have a badge of my own, one day..surely, one day...</p>
