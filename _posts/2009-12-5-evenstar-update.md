    <b>evenstar</b> is a dream, a dream that lets my imagination fly on wings of hope, hope that my prayers would be answered, answered with a gift, a gift that is worth everything I may ever be.
    <br>
    <br>They say necessity is the mother of all invention. For me, it has been the sucker of many odd hours at night leading to the development of a&nbsp;blogging engine. Yes,
