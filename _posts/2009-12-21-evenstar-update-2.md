It has been over two weeks since the last update on Evenstar. Before everyone thinks that this was just another idea that went down the drain, lemme assure you that its gonna be different this time. Over the last couple of days I have been working hard to finish up the first milestone build with all the features promised in the last post. What I have completed till today is the branding for 
<a href="http://myjerry.org/evenstar.html">evenstar</a>, along with the major features. I still have to wire some security code here and there, along with some nice little tweaks to the look and feel itself. Till I tie all this stuff up, you may take a look at the full size version of branding 
<a href="http://myjerry.org/evenstar.html">here</a>.
<br>
<br>You might noticed the words 
<b><a href="http://myjerry.org">myJerry</a></b> in there, yes, thats the abode where 
<b>evenstar</b> will reside. What is 
<a href="http://myjerry.org">myJerry</a>? It needs some more time before I jot down on the same. And this time I will not go to sleep, this time I will leave no stone unturned to make my dreams come true, for my prayers to go unanswered. For this is the time to do or there is no option to die ;)
<br>
<br>Let me know what you think on 
<a href="http://myjerry.org/evenstar.html">evenstar</a>, and I promise, 
<a href="http://myjerry.org/evenstar.html">evenstar</a> shall start lighting your dreams very soon!
