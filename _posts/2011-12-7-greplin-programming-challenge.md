Yesterday evening I came across another programming challenge called 
<a href="http://challenge.greplin.com/">Greplin Programming Challenge</a>. The challenge presents three problems which requires one to write small pieces of code to solve, and provide the solution as the password to the next level. Something similar to 
<a href="http://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a> problems.
<br>
<br>The challenge claims it may take from anywhere between 20 minutes and 2 hours. The first and second level are quite easy and should be completed within 15 minutes (including the time to fire up the IDE and keying in code, lazying around in bed). The third level requires some combinatory logic and thus may require a little extra time. I am done with the first 2 levels and planning for the third today evening.
<br>
<br>For those interested, the code is available on 
<a href="https://github.com/sangupta/greplin">my GitHub repository</a>.
<br>
<br>Looks like am developing a liking for coding problems... Anyone recommending another?
<br>
<br>Have. Fun. Coding.
