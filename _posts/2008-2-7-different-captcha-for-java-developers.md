A while ago I was just cruising from one website to another, when I came across 
<a href="http://myjavaserver.com">MJS - MyJavaServer.com</a>. A website that provides free Java hosting to developers so that they can go ahead and hone their web application skills.
<br>
<br>As with any usual website even they wanted me to signup. I am lured to test the service and without delay I clicked on the link. The page it led to attracted me to it. The signup form is not like every other. It includes a Challenge.
<br>
<br>
<b>SignUp Challenge</b>
<br>It requires you to write a simple Java program related to a web application. As you type in the code, it keeps compiling your code, showing the compilation errors. Once, the code compiles successfully, it runs a set of test cases against your code. If all the test cases pass successfully, then only the signup form is enabled.
<br>
<br>It was fun attempting the problem which took around 12 minutes to solve. Hope you would enjoy the same. Take the challenge here.
