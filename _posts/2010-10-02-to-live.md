```
I'm strong for I know my weaknesses,
I'm wise for I've been foolish,
I'm brave for I've conquered my fears,
I'm clever for I do my heart.

I laugh for I've known sadness,
I sing for I've been quiet,
I dance for I've stood still,
I walk for I've fallen often.

I sleep for the dreams,
I dream for I've hope,
I hope for I'm in love,
I love for, to love is to live.
```
