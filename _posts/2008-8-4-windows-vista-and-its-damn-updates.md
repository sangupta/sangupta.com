For millions of users like me, Windows comes as the default operating system which 
we get familiar and acquainted with. To use it on your computer becomes more of a 
standard than a choice, for computer manufacturers don't offer much systems on other 
OS platforms, and Apple tends to be too costlier.

On the same lines when I was looking for a laptop last year, I settled for a DELL 
machine with Windows Vista Home Premium pre-loaded. But today, I realize what a 
big mistake I made. Don't worry - not on the part of choosing DELL, but picking up 
Windows Vista.

Today morning, Windows downloaded and installed an update and then forced me to restart 
my computer, without any choice, when I did not wanted to. Then it took almost 15 minutes 
to shut down. At restart it showed me those ugly screens of loading registry entries 
and files. The screen displayed <b>Installing updates 1 of 3 (0% complete)</b>, and then 
it took another 70 minutes to see the login screen. Once iI authenticated my credentials 
it took another 15 minutes to load. Now this was frustrating, even after seeing the desktop 
I could not start any application, and even shut down again. I had already lost 100 minutes 
of my time, because Windows had installed some silly update which may be I didn't need.

When my patience left, I did a force shutdown and then a cold start. But to add insult 
to injury, things remained the same. Another 40 minutes, and I had to cold start my 
system in safe mode. Thank God, it was not slow this time and in couple of minutes I was 
to the admin console. Upon looking up for updates that were installed recently, I found 
the culprit.

<b>Windows Desktop Search 4.0</b> installed on <b>4 August 2008</b>. Damn hell, why did 
Microsoft installed a search system by default on my machine. I don't need and I hate 
desktop search softwares for the reason that they make the performance of the machines 
pathetic. It took me no time to click on the <b>Uninstall</b> button and then restart. Adding 
weird faces to the injury and insult, it has already been 90 minutes and my system still 
waits at the screen <b>Configuring updates: 3 of 3 (0% complete)</b>.

If only I could get a chance to speak to the Windows Development Team, I would take the 
opportunity to let them know that their thinking of doing everything on their own creates 
life's miserable for users like me.

**I already have lost more than 180 minutes (3 hours) of my time due to this and still counting.... :(**

Readers, if you could point me to a link where I can file this as a bug, please do let me know, I am more than eager to kick their a**.
