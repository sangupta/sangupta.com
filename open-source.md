Influence of Open Source
------------------------

Its been long I have been coding, since 1989 to be precise, with no formal computer science education. Everything
that I have learned can be attributed to all the source code published in public domain over all these years. My
first rememberance of the same is through `FTP` servers and `Bulletin Boards` that you accessed over the Internet
and downloaded each individual file, and later on `ZIP` files to read and study. Aided by books such as:

* Inside the IBM PC by Peter Norton
* Inside the IBM PC: Access to Advanced Features & Programming Techniques by Peter Norton
* The Peter Norton Programmer's Guide to the IBM PC
* Advanced MS-DOS Programming by Ray Duncan
* and many more...

that was my first hand experience of how professional software could be written. As a kid, it was **so magical**.

After I began coding, I made many of small utilities and tools to aid my own work. Even in college
I completed by `Surveying project` involving creation of a `topology sheet` and `Design of a School Building` by
writing custom `Java` code - it saved hell lot of time iterating over and over again, and making sure that we 
won the best project medal (as a team) at the end of the course as well.

Entering into the world of professional development, I wanted to contribute back to the place where I learned from:
the world of `open source`. Thus, began my journey with the <a href="//sangupta.com/projects/jerry">Jerry</a> project
in 2007 end, with the first cut commited in early 2008 in to `SourceForge`. The development was always slow, with
being connected the biggest hurdle and setting up different machines another one. Getting approvals from the `SF` team
for each new project or idea was again a pain - and keeping everything in a single repo a nightmare.

When `GitHub` launched and I joined as a member in mid-June, things really took off. It was super easy to create
multiple repositories, work offline and then sync when connected. Most of my spare time came during off-work hours,
mostly of weekends, vacations or otherwise when connectivity was limited.

Over the course of last 3 years, I am glad to have worked on more than 50 different ideas, all under open source,
with some reaching the maturity to be called as <a href="/projects/index.html">projects</a> and some still nascent 
infants to be called as <a href="/experiments/index.html">Experiments</a>.

I am sure many of the ideas from expriments will move to being **projects** with time. Till then, you can browse
them over in their respective places, and **you are most most welcome to join in and lend a helping hand**.

You may head over to the following project to learn more:

* <a href="/projects/index.html">Projects</a> - fully mature libraries, tools and applications that you may right
away use

* <a href="/experiments/index.html">Experiments</a> - to explore ideas that I work upon

* My <a href="https://github.com/sangupta">Git Hub</a> repository for any and everything.


Keep Walking and Keep Coding!
