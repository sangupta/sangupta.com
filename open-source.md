# Programming and Inclination to Open Source

I started programming as a child in 1989, with no formal computer science education. Internet had
not yet arrived for public in India and thus most of the programming knowledge came in from various books. 
Luckily being in [Roorkee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roorkee), a small-town with the great British-era
[Thomson College of Engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Institute_of_Technology_Roorkee), had 
access to their library with books plenty. FTP based internet came into reach and the beginning to download
the ZIP files spread across various `FTP` servers and `Bulletin Boards`.

Some of the books I have memories of going over again and again include:

* [Inside the IBM PC by Peter Norton](https://books.google.com/books?id=z4Y_AQAAIAAJ)
* [Inside the IBM PC: Access to Advanced Features & Programming Techniques by Peter Norton](https://books.google.com/books?id=Ysl0AAAACAAJ)
* [Advanced MS-DOS Programming by Ray Duncan](https://books.google.com/books?id=DQ_FQgAACAAJ)

Using Norton Commander and Norton Editor was my first hand experience of how professional software 
could be written. As a kid, it was <i>so so magical</i>.

My journey with programming involved writing tools and utilities to aid my studies and engineering. Graduating
in Civil Engineering, summa-cum-laude, we had no regular or elective courses to programming, but the fascination
had just deepened. Before my studies completed, I was able to automate [AutoCAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AutoCAD)
for generating **surveying topology sheets** or glue Java code to run multiple iterations for **building
frame design**. It saved a lot of time and also helped fetch the best project medals at the end of the course.

Early professional years were all about learning how to build production grade software and techniques used to
debug+fix bugs coming from the field. During these years one thing that echoed often was the redundant boiler
plate code we were churning out. Scratching the own itch led to my very first open-source project 
<a href="/projects/jerry">Jerry</a>, hosted on [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/jerry/) to 
[Google Code](https://code.google.com/archive/p/jerry/) and finally found its own shade in [Github](https://github.com/sangupta/jerry).

[Github](https://github.com) influenced my contributions to open-source, accelarating it up. And over the last few
years, the number of [some-what usable ideas](/projects/index.html) and the [ones in infancy](/projects/index.html#experiments) 
have grown to 100+, all safely in-shade in my [Github repository](https://github.com/sangupta).

Feel free to connect for any ideas, or if you would like to join-in to lend a helping hand.

Keep Walking!
