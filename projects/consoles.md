Java-based implementations for various consoles (pure text, swing-emulated and rich-text) that implement a standard API and pave
way for building better command-line tools in Java.

### WARNING

This library is in very nascent unstable stage and should NOT be used

### Aim

* JLine based pure console that works from a command-line shell of an operating system
* Swing based UI console that mimicks the shell of an operating system
* Consistent API for all console implementations

### Features

* Non-intrusive console implementation
* Easy replacement for System.in, System.out, System.err and Console 
* Support for mouse interactions to paste data
