Command line interface to interact with Amazon S3. The idea is to be able to perform
all S3 commands using the command-line as browser access is limited on Linux virtual
machines.

### Similar Projects

One similar project I know of is `s3cmd` from http://s3tools.org. One major drawback
of the tool is the non-availability on Windows platform. Another minor disadvantage,
may be not for everyone, is the dependency on `python` for execution. And that too an
incompatibility with `python 3`.
