A command line power-tool for Twitter based on https://github.com/sferik/t but in pure Java.

The reason for porting or migrating the project was to remove the dependency on Ruby, and second
add more commands that I find useful in every day work.

### Commands Supported

```
$ t authorize
$ t update "status"
$ t followers
$ t whoami
$ t version
```
