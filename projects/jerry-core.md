`jerry-core` is the base library on the lines of **Apache Commons** containing various utility classes and functions
that I have needed in product development over the last many years. The library helps us reduce the boiler-plate code
in any project and helps iterate faster.

The library is tested on the following JDK versions:

* Oracle JDK 8
* Oracle JDK 7
* Open JDK 7
