<h1>Jerry Web</h1>

`jerry-web` is a collection of Java `Servlet` filters, listeners, custom JSP tags and more that makes it a breeze to develop
server-side applications, specially running inside the container like `Tomcat` or `JBoss`. This has helped me reduce a lot of boiler
plate code in my applications.

A list of examples are listed below.

The library is tested on the following JDK versions:

* Oracle JDK 8
* Oracle JDK 7
* Open JDK 7

### Examples

### License

The library is released under the terms of **Apache Public License Version 2**.
