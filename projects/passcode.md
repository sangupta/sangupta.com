Password generator for desktops.

`passcode` is an application/library that can be used to generate highly-secure random password
for multiple sites based on a single master password and site/app-based keywords. This ensures that
each site uses a unique password and you cannot break another site's password if one site's password
is lost.

`passcode` is based on https://github.com/jcoglan/vault library which offers a similar solution.

`passcode` is a simple password manager. Given a passphrase and the name of a service, it returns a 
strong password for that service. You only need to remember your passphrase, which you do not give 
to anyone, and `passcode` will give a different password for every service you use. The passphrase 
can be any text you like.

Given the same passphrase and service name, the program will generate the same result every time, 
so you can use it to look up those impossible-to-remember passwords when you need them.

According to [Dropbox's zxcvbn password strength measure](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/209/zxcvbn/test/index.html), if your 
dictionary English password takes about a second to crack, those generated by vault take over a million 
times the age of the observable universe to crack by brute force.
