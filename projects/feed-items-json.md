Read/Write JSON-based feed items popularly exported by Google Reader, InoReader etc

### Need

Feed Readers usually export users data in JSON files which are in a format standardized by convention rather than
a standard. This library allows a developer to read/write such files easily via a `strongly typed Java` interface.

### License

The library is released under the terms of **Apache Public License Version 2**.
