<br>

A programmer with over 14+ years of professional experience in developing high-performance, scalable distributed
web applications, sometimes, mobile and desktop applications. 

I often write **open-source code** available at [GitHub](https://github.com/sangupta). I at-times write
about programming techniques and solution designs [here](https://github.com/sangupta/ps). Other random stuff
about smaller projects I keep working on is collated [here](https://sangupta.com/tech/archive.html) on this site.

Feel free to explore around, or drop me a comment. <b><i>Happy Hacking!</i></b>
