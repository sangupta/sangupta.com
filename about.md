## Developer, Gamer, Trance enthusiast, Poet, & a Compulsive Coder!

I have spent the last 11+ years building applications that target the desktop, the web, mobile devices
and now the tablets. Anything left or missed?

As they say, actions speak louder than words, for a developer, **Code** speaks louder than anything. 
Across the site you will find references to what I have done in the past, except during professional assignments. 

Feel free to explore, criticize or abuse. just, **Keep Walking!**
