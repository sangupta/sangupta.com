### Developer, Gamer, Trance enthusiast, and a Poet!

Hi, I'm Sandeep Gupta, a developer working for [Adobe Systems](http://adobe.com) based out of Delhi, India. I have spent the last 11+ years professionally building applications that target the desktop, the web, mobile devices and the tablets. I usually work on the server stuff, but am hands-on developing beautiful websites.

Across the site you will find references to what I have done in the past, except my professional assignments. All my code is
usually open-source, and can be on my [GitHub/sangupta](https://github.com/sangupta).

Feel free to explore, criticize or abuse. just, **Keep Walking!**
