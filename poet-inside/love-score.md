my fall will be for you,
to hold you in the wild. 
my rise will be of you,
when your heart smiles.

in every breath I live,
my love will be in you.
every day, every way,
my heart beats for you.

I lay my life and all faith
in your hands, my dear
if you be the one to cut me,
something will die, I fear.

hold me, love me,
change my stars,
heal my scars, or,
I will bleed forever.

my fall will be for you,
my love will be in you,
if you be the one to cut me,
I will bleed forever!

PS: inspired by [http://nightiwsh.com/](Nightwish)'s awesome song, [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8GOHJAnVh4](Ghost Love Score).
