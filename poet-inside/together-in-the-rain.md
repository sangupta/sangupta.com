Getting drenched in the rain
Walking hands in hand
Relieves me of all my pain
Makes me a complete man

Winds playing with her hair
Rain droplets kissing her face
Induces a sparkle in her eyes
Enhances her charm and grace

I wonder when would we be together
The long-awaited first chance
Her voice would be the music
Green grass, the floor to dance
