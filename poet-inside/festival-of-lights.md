On this festival of lights, I wish that someday might,
Good wins, Evil fails, Love & Only love prevails.

Lost is the sacred time, When hatred used to fear,
Screams of hope are now what we hear.

In time so tough today, I hope for a new beginning,
When humans pave the way, For a blessed meaning.

We burn in lamp's oil, earned through sweat and toil,
To illuminate the gloom, To defeat the doom.

I pray for you and all, For dreams to come true,
Almighty to shower his choicest blessings, on all & you!
