I just read this poem from one my very good friend: 
<a href="http://pilot-pooja.blogspot.com/2007/09/i-miss-you-mom.html">I 
miss you, MOM!</a> and this is what popped out of my head instantly. Mom, 
I miss you a lot... please come back soon. I am feeling hungry :)


```poem
I can't say why,
The poem made me cry,
It touched my soul,
Reminded me of her role,
Its not the air i breathe,
Inside me her love seethes,
I am what I am,
For behind me stands, my MOM!
```
