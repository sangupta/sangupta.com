A little of heart, a little of brain
in little of sun, n in little of rain
painting in zillion colors, thoughts so arcane
alive you bring, the canvas mundane
new heights with every step, you attain
all would agree, with me in fain
meaningful thoughts, your paradise contains
impression of which, in our minds always remain!
