Princess of Egypt!
------------------

You are the princess of Egypt and I'm just a man
I want to be with you, I feel astray
I need a miracle how to make you understand
I'd make you happy but you're far away

Its not a coincidence but our fate
We met on the magical day and date
Spent time sharing some jokes and laughter
Time flew by, when I wanted it to end never

You are the princess of Egypt and I'm just a man
I want to be with you, I feel astray
I need a miracle how to make you understand
That some numbers won't make me a different man

My thinking may be different in this life
My love will never change, nor will I ever strife
I've put my faith in you and it's not a time for a rest
Even though I did my best I didn't pass your test

You are the princess of Egypt and I'm just a man
I want to be with you, I feel astray
I need a miracle how to make you understand
I'd make you happy but you've to say

Not in a verse, or a line, but an etch
In your style when it suits you best
Engrave in my life the word I expect
magical three-letter wonder called, yes

You are the princess of Egypt and I'm just a man
I want to be with you, I feel astray
I need a miracle how to make you understand
Answer my prayers, for no one else can

Deep inside my heart, every moment I pray
In weather foggy, rainy, bright and clear
Let this happen every single day 
Wake me up as you on my b'day last year!

You are the princess of Egypt and I'm just a man!
