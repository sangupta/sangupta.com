Happy Birthday!
---------------

The things we feel the deepest
are the hardest things to say!

And that's what I gotta do
on the year's very special day!

A day specially crafted for us two
with zillion reasons to smile!

Precious moments between me and you
will last forever, not awhile!

God brought us together, my darling
to make me the man, you my only wife!

says the wise, that's the greatest thing
that has and will ever happen to my life!

Come, grow old with me
your hugs are always a charm!

Believe, the best is yet to be
for love keeps our hearts warm!

Oh my lovely beautiful wife
what I feel, words can never convey!

I wish the breath of my life
a very Happy Birthday!

**- For my beautiful darling Wife, on her birthday!**
