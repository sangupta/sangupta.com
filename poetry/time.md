Time
----

Time when life is good
time when things are bad
time when everything is worse
time when life seems a curse.

It's not the sin of time
but of the soul of mine
blind to the unmatching rhyme
of life that I played mime.

Time does not halt
time does not speed
time does not turn
time will not mislead.

In our soul lies the craft
of deceit, of game, of greed
the values of your human creed
where honesty will not succeed.

Time will not speak
time is always numb
time will not warn
time won't play the drums.

Then, why time be blamed
for life when cruellest
caused and claimed
by shards of the tempest.

Time will live
time won't die
to tell the betrayal tale
time will surely survive.
