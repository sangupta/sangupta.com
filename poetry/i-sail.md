I Sail!
-------

Clouds set in, bringing rain and hail
fragrance infects my thoughts
I find myself on a voyage
in the sea of dreams, I sail.

In between our jog on a spring dawn
with my fingers I spoil your hair
breathing the dew wet greens of our lawn
making sure you have no worries or a care.

We sing, laugh and play
away from summer's reach
building sand castles all day
on a beautiful island beach.

Watching trees shed leaf
under the rainbow in fall
a flash of white leaves us deaf
we rush to dance in the squall.

On a cold winter night
we escape snow and storm
in blanket soft and white
holding hands, we feel the warmth.

It may happen with any ray
the voyage ends, dreams shatter
yet, I write these songs today
for they will never weather!
