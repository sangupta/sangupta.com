The Proposal
------------

For the past decade, playing hide and seek,
is a wish, a dream, that had gone meek.
Since that day of vivid college images,
to this day of lonely voyages.

You changed my world with a blink of an eye,
that's something I cannot deny.
You put my soul from worst to best,
that is why I treasure you my dearest.

Your flawless beauty, your baby charm,
elegance, innocence, and the lively warmth.
The oasis you are, bringing in relief,
still ailing and lost in this beautiful belief.

Belief that waits in this world of ours,
for one lone soul another lonely soul.
Each choosing each through all the weary hours,
and meeting strangely at one sudden goal.

Brought chocolates, when should have flowers,
making my first mistake, in that evening hour.
Neither can I blame the ambience, nor the time,
responsibility of spoiling it, was only mine.

Had been waiting for you to ask,
so sudden, the question that came.
Unprepared, I created a mess,
when all I wanted was YOU, to say a YES!

To reveal so, my heart, 
I know is not the right way to start.
Couldn't think of a better way,
for you are so very far away.

Celebrating friendship on this day,
I steal this golden opportunity.
Of requesting to find time, if you may,
and heed to my long concealed plea.

My heart left its dwelling place,
and can return no more.
Like a fragrance, fill my inner voids,
help me make our own lore.

Years will pass, decades too,
I want to spend my whole life through.
With you beside me, till old we grew,
I wanna know, if you would want too?
