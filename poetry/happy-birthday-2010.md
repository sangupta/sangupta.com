Happy Birthday!
---------------

On this beautiful autumn day
when you wake up to the sun's ray
and a chill in the air's fray
tired of games, the dreams did play

Watch the numen blessed your way
with numerous strewn beautiful leaves
around you are your loved ones
with every word, a blessing who weave

Breathe the aroma of nature mother
dance in the arms of shine anew
embrace the goodness of next year 
where your every wish will be true

Accept these blooming flowers
filled with joy, from random showers
from garden of blessings, I picked them out
grown and nourished, from a tiny sprout

The only thing I'd like to say
to you on your special day
its your friend from far away
Wishing you a Very Happy Birthday!!!
