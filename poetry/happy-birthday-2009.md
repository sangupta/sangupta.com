Happy Birthday!!!
-----------------

colorful candles on the cake,
a mild blow is what it would take,
waiting for long, family and friends,
singing the universal celebration song.

feel the chill, embrace the weather,
hold your drink, loud say cheers,
to the music in the air, lend an ear,
in your very own day of the year.

remember the beautiful memories,
passing years can never mar,
rejoice the experiences big or small,
that have made you what you are.

time to weave new dreams,
of trekking in white mountains,
of walking in the dark lands,
of rowing the blue stream.

may the morning sun's rays,
bring every happiness your way,
with each passing moment, I pray,
fragrance of winter's makes you sway,
wishing you a very happy birthday!!!
