Your Smile
----------

If there ever was a way devised
to quantum how much I love you
and in my arms you could surmise
realizing, it, for sure to be true

No path was ever paved
nor the course ever shown
which may lead to the way
where love herbs are grown

But what love would be
if one were to discover such a path
none but the power demeaned
inviting your inner soulâ€™s wrath

for love is a blessing, not a wile,
whose fragrance can be felt
when looking at me, you smile
the magic making my heart melt!
