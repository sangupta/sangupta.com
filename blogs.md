I maintain the following two blogs as this is where my heart lies:

### <a href="/blog/tech.html">Tech</a>

As a river meanders between various lands and creates a course, learning many a things; this 
blog is a reflection of my musings during my ride in the roller-coaster called **code**.


### <a href="/blog/poetry.html">Poetry</a>

The music of language, intricate rhyme schemes, elegant phrases, vivid images - the art of 
poetry is enough to inspire many to write it. Poetry is the practice of creating artworks using 
language. What could be a better way than discovering the music inside yourself than Poetry? 
Words are the soul of any rythm, any sort of music.


In the past I have also contributed to the following blogs:

### <a href="http://goodtoknowit.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Thought Process - Good to know It</a>

A blog about invoking the though process by looking at various puzzles.
